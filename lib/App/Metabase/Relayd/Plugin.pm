=head1 NAME

App::Metabase::Relayd::Plugin - metabase-relayd plugins

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This document describes the App::Metabase::Relayd::Plugin system for 
L<App::Metabase::Relayd> and L<metabase-relayd>.

Plugins are a mechanism for providing additional functionality to
L<App::Metabase::Relayd> and L<metabase-relayd>.

It is assumed that plugins will be L<POE> based and consist of at least one
L<POE::Session>.

=head1 INITIALISATION

The plugin constructor is C<init>. L<App::Metabase::Relayd> uses 
L<Module::Pluggable> to find plugins beneath the App::Metabase::Relayd::Plugin
namespace and will attempt to call C<init> on each plugin class that it finds.

C<init> will be called with one parameter, a hashref that contains keys for each
section of the L<metabase-relayd> configuration file, (which utilises L<Config::Tiny>).

The role of the plugin is to determine if an appropriate section exists for its
own configuration.

If no appropriate configuration exists, then C<init> must return C<undef>.

If appropriate configuration does exist, then the plugin may start a L<POE::Session>.

L<App::Metabase::Relayd> will watch for a C<_child> event indicating that it has gained
a plugin child session. It will detach this child after making a note of the child's
session ID which it will use to send the following events.

=head1 EVENTS

=over

=item C<mbrd_received>

C<ARG0> will be a C<HASHREF> with the following keys:

 archname
 distfile
 grade
 osname
 osversion
 perl_version
 textreport

C<ARG1> will be the IP address of the client that sent the report.
