DESCRIPTION
    metabase-relayd is a Metabase relay server that acts an intermediate
    between Test::Reporter::Transport::Socket based CPAN Tester clients and
    a Metabase server.

COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
    Command line options override options given in the "CONFIGURATION FILE"

    "--debug"
        Turns on all output.

    "--help"
        Displays program usage and exits.

    "--version"
        Displays the program version and exits.

    "--idfile FILE"
        Specify a Metabase ID file to use.

    "--dbfile FILE"
        Specify the file that DBD::SQLite will use for the queue storage.

    "--url URI"
        The URL of a Metabase server to send reports to.

    "--address IP_ADDRESS"
        Specify a particular IP address for the listening socket to bind to.
        The default is INADDR_ANY. This may also be a comma-separated list
        of IP addresses, if you wish to bind to more than one address.

    "--port TCP_PORT"
        Specify the TCP port for the listening socket to bind to. The
        default is 0, ie. pick a random port.

    "--multiple"
        By default a single POE::Component::Client::HTTP instance is created
        and used to send each report. Enabling this option means that a new
        instance of POE::Component::Client::HTTP will be created for each
        report submitted.

    "--submissions INTEGER"
        In conjunction with "multiple" controls the number of concurrent
        submissions to the Metabase.

    "--norelay"
        Enable this so that reports are recorded to the database but not
        submitted to the Metabase.

CONFIGURATION FILE
    A number of the above options may be specified in a configuration file,
    "relayd", that is stored in the ".metabase" directory. See "ENVIRONMENT"
    for where the ".metabase" directory is located and how to effect its
    location.

    Command line options will override options from the configuration file.

    The configuration file is parsed using Config::Tiny.

    A subset of the command line options can be specified in the
    configuration file:

    "debug=BOOL"
        Set to a true value to turn on all output.

          debug=1

    "idfile=FILE"
        Specify a Metabase ID file to use.

          idfile=/home/bingos/.metabase/id.json

    "dbfile=FILE"
        Specify the file that DBD::SQLite will use for the queue storage.

          dbfile=/home/bingos/.metabase/relaydb

    "url=URI"
        The URL of a Metabase server to send reports to.

          url=https://metabase.example.url/

    "address=IP_ADDRESS"
        Specify a particular IP address for the listening socket to bind to.
        The default is INADDR_ANY. This may also be a comma-separated list
        of IP addresses, if you wish to bind to more than one address.

          address=192.168.0.254

          address=192.168.0.254,127.0.0.1

    "port=TCP_PORT"
        Specify the TCP port for the listening socket to bind to. The
        default is 0, ie. pick a random port.

          port=8080

    "multiple=BOOL"
        By default a single POE::Component::Client::HTTP instance is created
        and used to send each report. Enabling this option means that a new
        instance of POE::Component::Client::HTTP will be created for each
        report submitted.

          multiple=1

    "submissions=INTEGER"
        In conjunction with "multiple" controls the number of concurrent
        submissions to the Metabase.

          submissions=10

    "norelay=BOOL"
        Enable this so that reports are recorded to the database but not
        submitted to the Metabase.

          norelay=1

ENVIRONMENT
    "metabase-relayd" uses the ".metabase" directory to locate the
    configuration file, "relayd".

    This is usually located in the current user's home directory. Setting
    the environment variable "PERL5_MBRELAYD_DIR" will effect where the
    ".metabase" directory is located.

KUDOS

    this script/module.
